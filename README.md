# Final-Portfolio-Project
BAIS 3300 Final Website Project

In this final project, I will be applying all the skills I have learned throughout the semester to build my own portfolio website.

This site will be built using a mixture of HTML and CSS. In addition, Github and Microsoft Azure are used for pushing various changes on my webstie and how it will be launched on the internet. Finally, Google Analytics tags will be placed in the <head> tag of each page in order to track visitors.

Thank you for visitng my website and all the hardwork that was put into it!!
