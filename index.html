        <h2>About Carl</h2>
        <p>
          Carl is currently a senior at the University of Iowa who is also enrolled in the Digital Product 
          Management class. He plans to become a data analyst after graduation back in the city of Chicago. He 
          is an avid Cubs, Bears, Blackhawks, and Bulls fan. In his free time, he loves to play sports, 
          watch movies, listen to music, workout, and have a grand time with his friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to find him, he'll probably be at the golf course shooting 20 over and losing multiple balls,
          or with the guys of 922 E Washington at Brother's
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, you should totally ask him about how Justin Thomas is the best golfer in the world
          or how the Chicago Bears are winning the Super Bowl next season.
